# Weather Dashboard

## Description

The Weather Dashboard was created so that the user can search a specific city to get the current and future weather. You'll be given the date, the temperature, humidity, and wind speed currently and for the next five days. The search history will be saved in the sidebar so that previously searched cities are easily accessible.

In building this project, I used the OpenWeather API to get weather information for each city. I also used Day.js to get the current date and format the 5-day forecast. I used local storage to store recently searched cities.

## Usage

To use the Weather Dashboard, type a city into the search bar and click Search to retrieve weather information for that specific location. For quick access to your recent searches, click a city from the sidebard to retrieve its weather info.
